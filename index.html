    <h1>Hello World Wide Web!</h1>
    <p>
      Here's the deal: I decided to learn some basic web development and what would be better way than just create a website.
      As I don't have any idea about actual hosting, I figured that it would be easiest just to set it up here at GitHub.
      I can also refresh my memory on version control at the same time.
      I know there is a ton of frameworks and libraries to build beautiful websites and apps fast.
      However, as I want to learn how things actually work, I will start from very basics and build up from there. Adding things incrementally as I go.

        <h1>Hello World Wide Web!</h1>
        <p>
            Here's the deal: I decided to learn some basic web development and what would be a better way than just create a website.
            As I don't have any idea about actual hosting, I figured that it would be easiest just to set it up here at GitHub.
            I can also refresh my memory on version control at the same time.
            I know there is a ton of frameworks and libraries to build beautiful websites and apps fast.
            However, as I want to learn how things actually work, I will start from very basics and build up from there. Adding things incrementally as I go.
        </p>
        <p><strong>This is the action plan (subject to changes):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="doing">basics with html</li>
            <li class="doing">style it with css</li>
            <li>add some funtionality with Javascript</li>
            <li>backend and database</li>
            <li>???</li>
            <li>profit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ok, this looks terrible. Enough with html, let's add some css. i can add/fix the html later.</p>
        <p>Adding this paragraph on a mobile device.</p>
        <p>Let's see if we can make a box.</p>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <div class="box"></div>
    </body>
